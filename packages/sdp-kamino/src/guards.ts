/**
 * Refuse a plan whose instructions name a program that does not belong to this

 *
 * Why it exists: klend-sdk's `new KaminoVault(rpc, addr, state, programId)`
 * applies `programId` to account READS only and constructs its own internal
 * client WITHOUT forwarding it. The result is a vault that reads devnet state
 * and emits instructions addressed to the MAINNET kvault program — no error, no
 * warning, and a transaction that fails on-chain or, worse, succeeds against the
 * wrong deployment. Kamino's own published recipe uses that constructor, so this
 * is the default outcome for anyone following the docs.
 *
 * `./sdk.ts` binds reads and writes together so the trap cannot spring, and this
 * asserts that it worked. Belt AND braces, deliberately: the binding is a
 * convention inside one function, while this is a property of the OUTPUT, and
 * only the second one survives an SDK upgrade that reshuffles construction.
