/**
 * Give the share ATA's rent back, when and only when this exit empties it.
 *
 * ── Why this exists at all ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * klend's `withdrawIxs` bundle carries no cleanup instructions, so nothing ever
 * closed the share ATA. Its 2,039,280 lamports of rent-exemption stayed locked
 * in an account holding zero shares, for every position ever exited, reclaimable
 * by nobody. That was true before sponsorship and is not caused by it; sponsoring
 * rent only changes who is out the lamports.
 *
 * ── Why the condition is exact and not optimistic ─────────────────────────
 * SPL `CloseAccount` FAILS on a non-zero balance, and it rides in the same
 * transaction as the redemptions, so a wrong guess here does not leave rent
 * behind: it fails the customer's exit. The caller therefore passes the two
 * quantities that settle it rather than a boolean. Equality means the account
 * ends at zero, because the redemption instructions are separately asserted to
 * encode exactly `redeemedBaseUnits`. A partial exit returns null and correctly
 * leaves the account open, still holding shares and still holding its rent.
 *
 * `refundTo` must be whoever ACTUALLY funded the account, which for an account
 * that pre-dates this exit is the value recorded when it was created and never a
 * currently-configured sponsor: rent was paid then, the fee mode may have changed
 * since, and refunding "whoever sponsors today" would sooner or later pay a
 * sponsor with the customer's lamports. The caller resolves that; when the exit
 * ITSELF creates the account, the caller passes its own rent payer instead (see
 * `./sdk.ts`), because the recorded value then describes an older instance.
 * Omitted means the owner funded it and keeps it, which is also the correct
 * unsponsored default.
