 *  THE KIT-VERSION FIREWALL. This is the ONLY module in the package — source or

 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * klend-sdk is built against `@solana/kit` **^2.3.0**; this repo pins **6.8.0**.
 * Both copies coexist in the tree (pnpm nests the SDK's own). Verified by a live
 * round trip on 2026-08-15: instructions come back as plain objects with a
 * numeric `AccountRole` and `Uint8Array` data, and kit 6.8 compiles and signs
 * them unchanged — so the boundary is real at the TYPE level but inert at
 * RUNTIME. Every cast below is therefore a structural re-label, not a coercion,
 * and each is annotated with what makes it safe.
 *
 * Keeping the SDK behind this one module is also what keeps the 13MB dependency
 * out of `@sdp/earn`, whose catalogue cron runs hourly in both environments and
 * never builds a transaction.

 * Bind a vault so that READS AND WRITES USE THE SAME PROGRAM. Every entry point

 *
 * ── The trap, stated once ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `new KaminoVault(rpc, addr, state, programId)` looks like it binds the vault
 * to `programId`, and it half does: the id is used to FETCH `VaultState`, then
 * the constructor builds its own `KaminoVaultClient` **without forwarding it**.
 * Instruction building goes through that internal client, which defaults to
 * MAINNET. On devnet the result is a vault that reads `devkRng…` state and emits
 * instructions addressed to `KvauGM…` — silently, with no error.
 *
 * Kamino's own published recipe uses exactly that constructor, so this is the
 * default outcome for anyone following the docs. `loadWithClientAndState` is the
 * only factory that sets `vault.programId` AND `vault.client` together.
 *
 * `assertPlanTargetsCluster` independently re-checks the OUTPUT, because this
 * function's correctness is a convention inside one call and that assertion is a
 * property of what we actually emit.
