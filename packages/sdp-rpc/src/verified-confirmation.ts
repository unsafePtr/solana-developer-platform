/**
 * Verify that a caller-supplied signature actually landed on-chain before any
 * state is recorded from it. Three independent checks, each closing a hole the
 * previous one leaves open:
 *
 * 1. The signature must be confirmed (no error, past the `processed`-only
 *    stage) — a made-up signature fails here.
 * 2. When `expectAccount` is given, that account must now exist — a confirmed
 *    but unrelated transaction fails here.
 * 3. The transaction itself is fetched and returned so the caller can check it
 *    performed the expected operation — confirmed-signature + pre-existing
 *    account pairs fail in the caller's own check. `getSignatureStatuses` and
 *    `getTransaction` are indexed independently on the RPC, so a fresh
 *    transaction can be confirmed yet not queryable; that surfaces as
 *    `not_indexed`, which callers must treat as retryable rather than a
 *    permanent rejection.
 *
 * Verdicts are returned, not thrown; transient RPC failures are retried and
 * only rethrown once the retry schedule is exhausted.
