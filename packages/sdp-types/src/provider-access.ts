 * - **The catalogue sync and metrics refresh keep running**, so `earn_strategies`
 *   stays a truthful provider inventory and re-surfacing takes effect on deploy
 *   rather than after the next hourly pass. Same reasoning as
 *   `HIDDEN_STRATEGY_TERMS` in the API: filter at the policy boundary, never by
 *   refusing to store what a provider reports.

/**
 * How money reaches a provider's vault — the shape of its deposit, not whether

 *
 * - `custodial` — SDP provisions a provider-managed portfolio wallet and the
 *   customer funds THAT address. SDP never signs; it watches the address and the
 *   provider deploys on its own rebalance. Ground.
 * - `vault_direct` — the vault is non-custodial and takes an on-chain program
 *   instruction signed by the organization's selected custody wallet. There is
 *   no provider deposit address to fund; SDP builds and submits the custody-
 *   signed transaction. Kamino.
 *
 * **The difference is load-bearing in the UI and is not cosmetic.** A custodial
 * program has a real deposit ADDRESS a customer can send USDC to. A K-Vault does
 * not: its `providerReference` is the vault's program account, and presenting it
 * as a send target would destroy funds. Any surface that says "send funds to X"
 * must branch on this.
 *
 * Declared here rather than derived from a provider id at each call site, and
 * exhaustive over `EarnProviderId` so a new provider must state its shape. It
 * mirrors — and must agree with — the server-side `supportsPortfolioWallets`
 * capability, which the dashboard cannot see; a drift test in apps/sdp-api
 * asserts the two never disagree.
 *
 * ── One vocabulary, not two that happen to match (PRO-1705) ───────────────
 * A provider's deposit style IS the execution model every movement through it
 * is executed by, so this is `EARN_EXECUTION_MODELS` under the name that reads
 * correctly when the subject is a provider rather than a movement. The ledger's
 * `execution_model` column and this const therefore cannot drift apart.
 *
 * The aliasing is deliberate but not free: `EarnDepositStyle` and
 * `EarnExecutionModel` are now the SAME type, so the compiler no longer
 * distinguishes "how money reaches this provider" from "how this movement was
 * executed". That is sound precisely because they are one fact — but if a
 * provider ever gains a deposit style that is not an execution model (a second
 * way in to the same on-chain vault, say), this must become its own tuple again
 * rather than gaining a member here.
