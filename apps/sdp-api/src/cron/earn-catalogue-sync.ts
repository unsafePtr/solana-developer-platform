/**
 * Earn strategy-catalogue sync entrypoint.
 *
 * Two execution paths, both gated on the Earn feature flags by their callers:
 *
 * - **In-process cron** (`runEarnCatalogueSync`, self-hosted runtimes and
 *   explicitly opted-in services): mirrors `pending-transfers` — wraps the
 *   sync with a Sentry cron monitor when observability is supplied, and hands
 *   the resulting promise to the BackgroundRunner so it survives past the
 *   initiating tick and drains during graceful shutdown.
 * - **Managed Cloud Run Job** (`runEarnCatalogueSyncIfDue`, `src/job.ts`):
 *   each deployment-scheduled tick claims an hourly Redis slot first and skips
 *   quietly when the slot is held — the catalogue cadence stays
 *   `EARN_CATALOGUE_SYNC_CRON` no matter how often the job runs.
 *
 * The sync iterates every registered vault-infra provider per environment,
 * pulls the live strategy catalogue, and upserts it into `earn_strategies`
 * keyed on (provider, provider_reference, environment) — the only admitting
 * writer for that table. Each provider pass then DELISTS: rows the
 * provider no longer lists are deleted (`deleteUnlistedFromCatalogue`), so the
 * table converges on the live catalogue instead of only ever growing — that is
 * what makes a tightened catalogue gate reach rows already stored.
 * It degrades provider-by-provider: one
 * provider failing (or still being a NOT_IMPLEMENTED stub) must never sink
 * the others' pass. Adding a provider is a registry change only
 * (`EARN_PROVIDER_CLIENTS`) — neither execution path names providers.
