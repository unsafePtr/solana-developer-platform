/**
 * Earn strategy METRICS refresh — the fast half of the catalogue.
 *
 * The catalogue sync (`earn-catalogue-sync.ts`) runs hourly because catalogue
 * DRIFT is slow: a provider onboarding or delisting a vault. Rates are not
 * slow. An APY on a comparison table is a number a customer compares vaults by
 * and then moves money on, and an hour-old one is not that number. So the
 * volatile figures get their own frequent pass, while identity, mints,
 * liquidity terms and admission to the catalogue stay hourly. Self-hosted
 * scheduling uses five minutes; managed scheduling follows the deployment's
 * Managed Reconciliation Cadence.
 *
 * Two properties keep the two passes from fighting:
 *
 * - **This pass can only UPDATE.** `updateStrategyMetrics` matches on
 *   (provider, provider_reference, environment) and no-ops when nothing
 *   matches, so a provider reporting figures for a vault the catalogue refused
 *   cannot admit it. Every admission gate stays in the hourly sync.
 * - **It cannot change what a strategy IS.** The input carries the rate and
 *   volatile risk metadata and nothing else, and the metadata is MERGED so
 *   slow-moving fields the sync owns (curator above all) survive.
 *
 * Participation is by capability (`supportsLiveMetrics`), so this is a registry
 * change and never a named list. For why this is a write pass rather than a
 * live read, and which providers should not implement it, see
 * `EarnLiveMetricsProvider` in @sdp/earn/types.
 *
 * **Every provider read is bounded** (`EARN_PROVIDER_METRICS_DEADLINE_MS`).
 * `src/job.ts` runs this pass first and awaits it before the catalogue sync
 * inside a 120s Cloud Run task, so an unbounded read here would not just cost
 * this pass its rates — it would spend the execution and take the catalogue
 * sync down with it, every tick, for as long as the provider stayed slow.
