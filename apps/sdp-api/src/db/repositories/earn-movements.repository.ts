 * Newest claimant wins, matching "the account is created at most once and the

 * both intent creators take it through their claim upsert or their own
 * transaction, and `advanceVaultMovement` takes it explicitly.
 *
 * ── The confirmed-fork tail, and why excluding only `failed` is enough ─────
 * A claimant that reached `confirmed` and was then dropped by a fork can never
 * be failed (the transition matrix forbids `confirmed -> failed` on purpose;
 * see @sdp/types EARN_MOVEMENT_TRANSITIONS), so its claim stays selected here.
 * That inherits the ledger's own accepted open question rather than adding a
 * new reachable loss: the dropped create never landed, so the account is still
 * missing, and an exit only reads this projection when the account EXISTS at
 * its build (an exit that creates the account refunds its own rent payer and
 * ignores the projection). Whoever re-created it was either a later SDP
 * movement, whose newer claim supersedes the stale one, or an external actor,
 * which is the already-documented external-create residual, reachable with or
 * without any fork. Confirming the funder from the LANDED transaction at
 * settlement closes both and is deliberately not attempted here.
