-- Private Channels (SPC): the whole feature's schema, in one migration.
--
-- Tables are declared in dependency order — the connected instance, then its
-- channels, members and event feed, then deposits, withdrawals, the oracle's
-- settlement observations, and verified wallets. Every statement is
-- IF NOT EXISTS, so re-running is a no-op.


-- ==========================================================================

-- SPC connection metadata. At most one active row per project; inactive rows
-- are kept as history so a same-gateway reconnect can reuse the id. Downstream
-- tables reference private_channel_instances.id, so Delete cascades and swap

-- private channel deposits

-- Deposit intents that move `amount` of `mint` from a custody wallet into the
-- instance's escrow on-chain, credited to `recipient` in the channel by the
-- operator. Lifecycle: pending -> submitted -> confirmed -> settled (or
-- failed). Amounts are decimal strings, never numeric/float.
--
-- Deposits are FINANCIAL/AUDIT records: `instance_id` is denormalized with NO
-- FK so a deposit survives instance deletion; the delete handler rejects
-- deletion while non-terminal deposits exist.
--
-- A deposit terminates at `confirmed` (tx confirmed on-chain). The operator's
-- SPC-side credit is off-chain and not observable by this reconciler, so
-- `settled` stays unreachable for deposits. The UI surfaces the credit via the
-- SPC channel-balance read on the deposit page.
--
-- `context` is an audit-only JSONB snapshot of the SPC instance parameters at
-- intent time (gateway URL, chain RPC, escrow addr, acting user). NEVER
-- consulted by the oracle or the poll handler — reconciliation always reads
-- the current instance row so an operator can repoint a stale endpoint without
-- stranding in-flight intents. Purely for forensics; secrets redacted at
-- render time (see redactCredentialSecrets).

-- private channel withdrawals

-- channel-chain balance, later settled by the operator releasing real USDC on
-- devnet from the instance escrow ATA to `destination`. Lifecycle: pending ->
-- submitted -> confirmed -> settled (or failed). Amounts are decimal strings.
--
-- Withdrawals are FINANCIAL/AUDIT records: `instance_id` is denormalized with
-- NO FK so a withdrawal survives instance deletion. `context` is the same
-- audit-only snapshot as private_channel_deposits above.
--
-- Under the chain-heuristic oracle a withdrawal CAN reach `settled`: after
-- `confirmed` (burn seen on the channel chain), the oracle scans the escrow
-- ATA on devnet for a matching release transfer, records the attribution in
-- private_channel_settlement_observations, and advances the intent with
-- settlement_ref = the release signature. A withdrawal may park at `confirmed`
-- indefinitely if the operator's release hasn't landed — never auto-failed

--     several releases in a single tx without collision.
--   UNIQUE (intent_kind, intent_id) — each intent can only settle once.
--     Concurrent pollers racing to claim the same release collide here; the
--     loser reads the winner's row and returns the same settlement_ref.
--
-- The oracle decides from copied-in values (destination/mint/amount) rather
-- than re-reading the intent row, so external mutations can't retroactively

-- private channel transfers

-- Private Channels transfers move tokens between two verified member addresses
-- on the channel chain. Amounts are decimal strings (never numeric/float).
--
-- These rows are FINANCIAL/AUDIT history. Instance, channel, member, custody
-- wallet and verification identifiers carry NO FK, so disconnecting an instance,
-- archiving/deleting a channel, revoking a member or deleting a wallet
-- verification cannot erase transfer history. Only the owning org/project
-- cascade, since nothing in the row is meaningful once those are gone.
--
-- Lifecycle: a row is inserted as `pending` BEFORE anything is broadcast, then
-- `submitted` once SPC accepts the transaction at ingress, then `confirmed` once
-- a signature-status read shows it executed cleanly. `failed` covers preparation
-- errors, ingress rejection and execution errors. `confirmed` is terminal: SPC
-- runs one sequencer with no fork choice, so a single status read is final and
-- there is no `settled` (nothing leaves the channel).
--
-- A row still in `pending` means the request died mid-flight. A row still in
-- `submitted` means the confirm read never returned a verdict — a transport
-- error, or a dedup drop (stale blockhash / duplicate) that SPC discards without
-- telling the caller. Nothing sweeps either; both are operator signals.
