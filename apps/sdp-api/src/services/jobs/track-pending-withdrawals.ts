/**
 * Background Job: Track Pending Private Channel Withdrawals
 *
 * State machine: pending → submitted → confirmed → settled (terminal) | failed.
 *
 * Reconciles non-terminal withdrawals each cron tick:
 *  1. `pending` with no burn signature, stuck > 5 min → failed (never broadcast).
 *  2. `submitted` with a burn signature → getSignatureStatuses on the CURRENT
 *     instance gateway → `confirmed` / `failed`; signature not found + stale →
 *     failed. This is the ONLY window where a withdrawal can auto-`failed`
 *     (pre-burn-confirmation — no balance moved yet).
 *  3. `confirmed` → `settled` via the polling oracle: scan the CURRENT
 *     instance's escrow ATA on devnet for outgoing SPL transfers matching a
 *     withdrawal's (destinationAta, mint, baseUnits), CLAIM the match by
 *     inserting into `private_channel_settlement_observations` (UNIQUE guards
 *     against double-claim + racing pollers), then CAS-advance the withdrawal
 *     to `settled` with `settlement_ref = signature`. Stale unmatched → operator
 *     `TRANSFER_STUCK_WARNING` (debounced via `context.lastStuckWarningAt`),
 *     never auto-`failed` — the balance is already burned.
 *
 * The release reconciler resolves the project's CURRENT RPC connection each
 * tick, so provider changes and credential rotations apply to in-flight intents.
 * The audit context on each withdrawal is never consulted here.
 *
 * All status transitions are compare-and-swap (`expectedStatus`) so a concurrent
 * worker can't regress state. Release attribution is by content
 * `(destinationAta, mint, base-unit amount)`, FIFO within the single-flight
 * bucket, so it cannot disambiguate two withdrawals sharing all three; a
 * memo/withdrawId on the release tx would make it exact.
