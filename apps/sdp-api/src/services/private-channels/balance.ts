/**
 * Channel balance read.
 *
 * Balances live at the SPC layer, one per (wallet, mint), derived by reading the
 * owner's classic-Token ATA through the gateway. Logical channels are labels, so
 * a wallet in multiple channels shows the SAME balance in each — never
 * materialize a per-channel balance.
 *
 * The connection comes from the project's ACTIVE persisted instance (loaded by
 * the caller and passed in), matching the config-in pattern used by the rest of
 * this service. The transport (`createChannelGatewayRpc`/`getChannelTokenBalance`)
 * is config-source-agnostic.
