/**
 * Private Channels withdrawal flow.
 *
 * Burns `amount` of the instance mint from the custody wallet's CHANNEL-chain
 * balance (via the withdraw program = an SPL Burn), then the operator later
 * releases the matching real USDC on devnet to `destination`. The burn is
 * server-signed by the custody wallet (the burn `user`) and broadcast to the
 * GATEWAY (the channel chain) — NOT devnet, unlike the deposit escrow tx.
 *
 * Signing model: SDP custody wallet, server-signed — same as deposits;
 * the wallet is the sole signer and (for now) self-pays the channel-chain fee.
 * TODO(gasless/fees): confirm the gateway fee model for gateway-broadcast txs and
 * wire a sponsored fee payer if the gateway requires one.
 *
 * Gateway auth: broadcasting the burn is a gateway WRITE and confirming it a
 * gateway READ — both JWT-gated. The caller's SPC session is resolved by the
 * handler and passed in as `gatewayAuth` (a self-refreshing handle, shared across
 * broadcast + confirm).
 *
 * Lifecycle here: pending (persist) → submitted (broadcast) → confirmed (burn
 * confirmed on the gateway). `settled` is reached asynchronously by the oracle
 * once the operator's devnet release is observed on the instance escrow ATA.
 * After `confirmed` the balance is authoritatively burned, so an unobservable
 * release is a settlement issue → operator alert, never auto-`failed`.
