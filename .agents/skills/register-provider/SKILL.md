# Register a ramp provider

Build the smallest honest skeleton for the capabilities the provider supports. Registration spans three ownership boundaries:

- `packages/sdp-payments`: HTTP adapter and normalized ramp contract.
- `apps/sdp-api`: auth, policy gates, DB orchestration, provider availability, schemas, and webhooks.
- `packages/sdp-types` / `apps/sdp-web`: shared public shapes and provider presentation.

## 1. Add the closed provider id

Add the lowercase id to `RAMP_PROVIDERS` in `packages/sdp-types/src/provider-access.ts`. `GENERAL_PROVIDER_DEFAULTS.ramps` currently enables every registered ramp for every organization; availability still fails closed when deployment credentials are absent. Registration is therefore a launch decision, not a hidden stub. Do not add the id until the implemented capability is safe to surface.

Run these immediately and follow every exhaustive error:

```bash
pnpm --filter @sdp/payments typecheck
pnpm --filter @sdp/api typecheck
pnpm --filter sdp-web typecheck
```

The compiler is only part of the checklist; Zod unions, translations, and ordered UI lists may not fail automatically.

## 2. Add the package adapter

Create `packages/sdp-payments/src/ramps/providers/<id>/client.ts` and export/register it in `packages/sdp-payments/src/ramps/index.ts`:

```ts
export class <Id>RampClient implements RampProvider {
  readonly id = "<id>";
  readonly declaredRailSupport = <ID>_DECLARED_RAIL_SUPPORT;
  // Implement the methods required by packages/sdp-payments/src/ramps/types.ts.
}
```

`RampProvider` currently requires both estimates, rail discovery/distillation, counterparty validation, and an off-ramp method. An unsupported direction must use empty declared/discovered support plus a typed unsupported requirement or payments error; it must not pretend to work. `createOnrampQuote` remains optional.

Use one mode-aware config reader over the passed `env`. Provider code performs HTTP only and imports neither `AppContext` nor database modules. Use `providerFetchJson` for provider requests and payments-package errors such as `providerNotConfigured`, `providerUnavailable`, and `estimateNotAvailable`.

If API-side handlers import provider-specific public helpers or types through package subpaths, add explicit exports in `packages/sdp-payments/package.json`.

## 3. Wire API admission and orchestration

Update every applicable site:

| Site | Decision |
|---|---|
| `apps/sdp-api/src/services/provider-availability.service.ts` | label plus prod/sandbox credential completeness; `testMode === undefined` means either configured mode |
| `apps/sdp-api/src/services/provider-setup-registry.ts` | add `rampSetup("<id>")`; ramps are deployment-managed today |
| `apps/sdp-api/src/routes/payments/schemas.ts` | add the provider-specific submit-requirements schema arm |
| `apps/sdp-api/src/routes/counterparties/schemas.ts` | add the id only to the directions actually supported |
| `apps/sdp-api/src/routes/payments/handlers/ramps.ts` | add quote and `advanceCounterpartyRequirements` branches for every provider; unsupported directions reject explicitly; keep DB work here or in `handlers/ramps/<id>.ts` |
| `apps/sdp-api/src/routes/webhooks/handlers.ts` | register a processor, or explicitly add the id to the excluded no-webhook providers |

Availability is tri-state by environment:

```ts
isConfigured: (env, testMode) => {
  const prod = hasAllEnv(env, ["<PROVIDER>_KEY", "<PROVIDER>_SECRET"]);
  const sandbox = hasAllEnv(env, ["<PROVIDER>_SANDBOX_KEY", "<PROVIDER>_SANDBOX_SECRET"]);
  if (testMode === true) return sandbox;
  if (testMode === false) return prod;
  return prod || sandbox;
},
```

Do not add obsolete `executeOnramp` / `executeOfframp` branches; those methods are not part of the current provider contract.

## 4. Extend shared contracts

Add the provider to a closed `PaymentRampQuote` arm in `packages/sdp-types/src/payments.ts`, even when an existing delivery-mode shape fits; for example, extend the provider literal on the hosted arm. Add a `PaymentRampInstruction` arm for a new manual instruction shape. The supported delivery modes are:

- `manual_instructions`: bank or crypto funding instructions.
- `hosted`: a provider-hosted URL.
- `session_widget`: an embedded provider session.

Add provider-specific onboarding states to `packages/sdp-types/src/ramp-requirements.ts` only when the existing generic states cannot represent the upstream lifecycle. Extend `RampTransferSettlement` when signed settlement events carry provider-specific economics worth preserving. Update `apps/sdp-api/src/openapi/**` when the public request or response contract changes, then run the owning generators from `AGENTS.md`.

```bash
pnpm -C apps/sdp-api openapi:generate
pnpm generate:api-playground
pnpm -C apps/sdp-docs generate:api
pnpm -C apps/sdp-docs generate:ai
```

## 5. Declare environment keys

Add every runtime key to all environment-contract projections that consume API keys:

1. `apps/sdp-api/src/types/env.d.ts`
2. `turbo.json` `globalEnv`
3. `scripts/secret-keys.mjs` `API_LOCAL_ENV_KEYS`
4. `apps/sdp-api/.env.local.example` with commented placeholders and no real credentials

If the provider has distinct webhook keys, API base URL overrides, account ids, or sandbox-only settings, include those exact keys too. A missing required key must produce `PROVIDER_NOT_CONFIGURED` (503).

## 6. Surface the provider in the dashboard

At minimum update:

- `apps/sdp-web/src/lib/ramps.ts`: logo and ordered label option.
- `apps/sdp-web/src/app/dashboard/integrations/integrations-status.ts`: label and description key.
- `apps/sdp-web/messages/*/shared.json`: provider description in every locale.
- `apps/sdp-web/public/provider-logos/`: provider asset.

If the provider introduces a new onboarding lifecycle, manual instruction shape, or session-widget fields, update the provider helpers and quote renderer under `apps/sdp-web/src/app/dashboard/payments/ramps/`. Reuse an existing delivery-mode renderer only when its contract already fits.

## 7. Document setup and limits

Update `apps/sdp-docs/content/docs/payments/ramps-providers.mdx` with supported directions, rails, entity/country limits, sandbox behavior, required environment keys, webhook setup, and known limitations. Keep public endpoint claims aligned with `apps/sdp-api/src/openapi/**`, then run:

```bash
pnpm --filter sdp-docs check:links
pnpm --filter sdp-docs build
```

## Verify

Add mocked provider-client tests and focused API tests for supported directions, unsupported directions, malformed responses, missing credentials, counterparty gating, and webhook verification when applicable. Then run:

```bash
pnpm --filter @sdp/payments typecheck
pnpm --filter @sdp/payments lint
pnpm --filter @sdp/payments test
pnpm --filter @sdp/api typecheck
pnpm --filter @sdp/api test -- <focused-test-files>
pnpm --filter sdp-web typecheck
pnpm --filter sdp-web check:i18n
pnpm check:module-boundaries
```

Continue with `rail-discovery`, `integrate-estimate`, `counterparty-requirements` for every provider, the needed quote direction skill, and `integrate-webhook` when settlement is server-notified.
